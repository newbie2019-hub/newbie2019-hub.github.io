I spent countless hours trying to understand how things work, figuring out how to implement features, and building personal projects, mostly by following YouTube tutorials, reading documentations, and searching for answers on StackOverflow whenever I encounter a bug. Over time, I discovered how much I enjoyed the process of creating something from scratch. It’s a journey filled with challenges, but every small win keeps me motivated to keep improving."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What fascinated me the most was how being a developer constantly pushes you to learn—whether it’s understanding how something works or exploring new technologies. This passion for learning not only deepened my skills but also helped support my studies. Looking back, those early struggles laid the foundation for the developer I am today."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As someone who’s constantly exploring different technologies and tech stacks, I’ve found it challenging to remember all the important details, especially those that aren’t always obvious in official documentation. While docs are a great reference, there are often crucial insights or practical applications that only come to light when you’re actually working on a project. Writing blogs helps me capture these key takeaways and organize my thoughts in a way that’s easy to revisit later."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Through blogging, I can dive deeper into specific technologies or challenges I’m working on and create a personal resource to guide me in future projects. It’s like building a personalized knowledge base—something I can refer back to when I need clarity or direction. By reflecting on my experiences and documenting my processes, I not only solidify my understanding but also make it easier to pick up where I left off. This practice has become an invaluable part of my learning process and growth as a developer."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I want to be honest—while I can speak English conversationally, writing blogs has always been a challenge for me.
